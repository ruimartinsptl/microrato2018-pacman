/*
This Arduino code will let you to measure some of the parameters of IR remote like Period, Frequency, High time and Low time.
This information is very much useful while doing reverse engineering of any IR remote.
For measuring this quatities, we require a DSO, But everyone may not have one at there home, so they can use this Arduino code
to measure all this parameters.
This code can be regarded as a Trial and Error method.Sometimes the readings capture by photodiode are not same as we have expected.
So I request you to carry recording 5-7 times to get accurate result.
When I was experimenting with different Remotes, I found that most of the remotes have below mentioned parameters only and they are fixed,
High Time = 12 microseconds
Low Time  = 16 microseconds
Period    = 28 microseconds
Frequency = 35.7kHz
